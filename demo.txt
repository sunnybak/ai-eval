1. 3 min - quick intro to ai-eval + why ai-eval
2. 2 min - jump into code_suggester example

3. 5 min - describe fixed test

- describe what the generator is
- - seeding
- - fixed trajectory generator quick description
- - synth trajectory generator quick description

- describe what the scorer is
- - make sure to mention FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE, plz use whatever u want

- describe what the evaluator is
- - pass_range & in_range functions
- - just checks that the score is in your "range" which is FULLY CUSTOMIZABLE

- point out the consistency parameter - start low..
- - evaluator might be non-determ, generator might be non-determ, app is definitely non-determ
- - more non-determ -> more need for consistency check

4. 3 min - prompt iteration experience
- increase consistency
- change prompt
- run it again

the triangle philosophy 
- evaluator -> app -> dataset -> evaluator
- don't game the test, if the system is breaking.. fix the system
- be very sure if you are changing the evaluator
- versioning is important!

5. 3 min - model experimentation
- set multiple models
- run it again

(Optional section: synth generator depending on time left)

6. next steps
- talk about roadmap
- optimal stopping, etc
